              Hello and welcome to my portfolio! I'm thrilled to have you here.
              My name is Atenas G.I, a passionate Front-end Developer originally
              from Mexico and currently based in the United Kingdom. Since my
              early years, I have been drawn to the world of technology and
              design. My journey as a developer began when I got my hands on my
              first computer, and I was immediately captivated by the endless
              possibilities of the digital realm. As I delved deeper into the
              world of coding, I realized that creating visually appealing and
              user-friendly websites was my true calling. Moving to the UK has
              been an enriching experience. It has allowed me to embrace new
              perspectives, collaborate with diverse teams, and learn from
              talented professionals in the tech industry. I've come to
              appreciate the power of unity and diversity, and I apply these
              principles not only in my projects but also in the way I
              collaborate with others. With a strong command of HTML, CSS,
              JavaScript, and various front-end frameworks, I am dedicated to
              crafting responsive, accessible, and high-performance websites. My
              curiosity and love for learning drive me to stay updated with the
              latest industry trends and technologies, ensuring that I deliver
              modern and cutting-edge solutions. Beyond coding, exploring new
              places and cultures gives me a fresh perspective that inspires my
              creativity and fuels my passion for innovation. I am always eager
              to take on exciting projects and collaborate with like-minded
              individuals and teams. If you are looking for a dedicated and
              skilled Front-end Developer with a flair for creativity and an eye
              for detail, I would be thrilled to connect and discuss how we can
              bring your ideas to life. Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and
              I look forward to connecting with you soon!
